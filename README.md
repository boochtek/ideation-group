# IDEA: App Ideation Group

- Insight: We're all craving working on something we really believe in
- Insight: We're all craving working on something we have more control over
    - We all believe in self-organized teams
- Meet one night a week?
- Each person presents 1 idea for an app
    - Or maybe we only have time for 1 idea per week
- Group tries to assess feasibility of profitability
    - Estimated cost of MVP
        - Assume $200/hr for our labor
        - Assume things will take twice as long as expected
    - Estimated monthly costs
        - Infrastructure
        - Support
        - Marketing
    - Estimated pricing
    - Estimated customer base
    - Estimated revenue
    - Difficulty marketing and selling
    - Likely competition
    - Likely road blocks
    - Any legal concerns?
- We'd need to come up with a way to split equity for any projects we implement
    - Hourly rate for labor (sweat equity)
        - Design, coding, infrastructure work, additional ideation, meetings, coordinating outsourced work
        - I think $200/hr seems fair for our group
            - Especially when none of us have to pay that
                - It would all come out of future revenues
    - Shares for coming up with the original idea
        - This one is hardest to determine
        - A standard percentage?
            - But all our other shared valuations are expressed in hours/$
        - Voting by the membership?
            - I like this idea
                - It also helps determine which ideas are worth pursuing
                - It provides some gamification
            - Vote how many hours/$ the idea is worth
            - Vote how many hours/$ you'd be willing to contribute to see an MVP built
                - Is really hard to take these commitments as very stable though
    - Shares for being part of ideation meetings
        - Should that include previous ideation meetings?
    - Shares for actual money spent on infrastructure, outsourcing, etc.
        - Probably at a multiple of money spent
            - Because this is money put at risk of loss
                - Opportunity cost of time spent is also high, but we're compensating a lot for that, and that's opportunity cost, not necessarily actual cost
- Membership requirements
    - Invitation only
        - Supermajority approval (75%?)
    - Proven (to other members) record of intelligence, good ideas, and ability to execute building applications
- Governance
    - Group would need a way to vote people in
        - Keeping the group small (4-10) would probably be best
        - Supermajority (75%?)
    - Group would need a way to vote people out
        - Supermajority (75%?)
    - Individual projects would be governed based on voting by the shares in the project
        - Would probably need a way for people to get out
            - Asked by the team to no longer contribute
                - Some supermajority (60%?) of shares would probably be fair for this
            - Bought out from future profits
                - This is hard to figure out an answer to
                - Depends a lot on whether all sweat equity has been paid off or not
                - Depends a lot on expected future profits, time value of money, etc.
                - Depends a lot on how much the project itself has in assets
                - Depends on whether they're being pushed out or wanting to get out
                - Majority rule (by shares) could cut someone out of too much money that they're owed
                    - So it's important that we figure this out ahead of time
                    - Requiring a supermajority might prevent someone from getting out when they need/want to
